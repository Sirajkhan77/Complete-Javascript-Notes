/// When we create array
let arr=[1,2,3,4];
// and  now when we put a dot 'arr.' , many functions are appeared. These functions are those methods . they are defined in the prototype of this array... 
//array have prototype?
/// JS creates an array like this 
let arr2=new Array(1,2,3,4);// Internally ye kam ho raha hota arr1 ki creation pe 

//hence it will have prototype which have many methods
console.log(Array.prototype);
